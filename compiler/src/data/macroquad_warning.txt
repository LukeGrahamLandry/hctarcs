// TODO: instead of printing at this comptime, have a cargo feature that we pass on the command line when compiling for wasm and [cfg(all(not(feature="allow_sketchy_wasm"), arch="wasm32"))] compiler_error!(this message)
// TODO: that way i dont have to always print but can give hint to avoid confusion and if they know what they're doing they can jsut provide the feature themselves when building

WARNING: Macroquad doesn't play nice with wasm-bindgen.
The Hctarcs compiler provides a hacky fix it, but it means the web target cannot be built as a normal cargo+wasm_bindgen project anymore.
You need to run Hctarcs with --web every time. (SAD: cargo build script can't run after compiling).
