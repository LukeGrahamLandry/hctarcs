# hctarcs: Compile Scratch to Rust 

> Compiling scratch projects to native executables just seems backwards! 

- Implemented: Arithmetic & Logic, Global and Sprite Variables
- Almost: Custom Blocks, Pen, Movement
- Missing: Looks, Sound, broadcasts, Wait, Rotation, Glide, Bounce, Cloning, Lists, User Input (keyboard & mouse)
- (Almost) Working Projects: [Johan-Mi/linrays](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/726052645)
